notes for "Linux Kernel Development" 3rd edition

##goal of this book
This book targets Linux developers and users who are interested in understanding the Linux kernel. It is not a line-by-line commentary of the kernel source. Nor is it a guide to developing drivers or a reference on the kernel API. Instead, the goal of this book is to provide enough information on the design and implementation of the Linux kernel that a sufficiently accomplished programmer can begin developing code in the kernel.
